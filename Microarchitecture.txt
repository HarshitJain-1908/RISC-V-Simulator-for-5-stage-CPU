Microarchitecture Decisions:

1. Branches are resolved in the Decode stage itself. This decision is taken to reduce the branch penalty 
from 2 instruction to only 1 instruction.

2. run cpu.py using python3 cpu.py and enter custom defined instrcution memory and data memory delay.
   And, relevant graphs would pop up. All the information about data stalls, number of memory instructions
   and data instructions are stored in the log file.
