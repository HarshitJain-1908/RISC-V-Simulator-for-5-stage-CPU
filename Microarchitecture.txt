Microarchitecture Decisions:

1. Branches are resolved in the Decode stage itself. This decision is taken to reduce the branch penalty 
   from 2 instruction to only 1 instruction.
   
2. In case instruction memory has more than one delay, the new instruction from the target is fetched
   as soon the branch is resolved.

3. Except from memory instructions(LW, SW, LOADNOC, STORENOC) all other instructions are considered as 
   register type instructions.
